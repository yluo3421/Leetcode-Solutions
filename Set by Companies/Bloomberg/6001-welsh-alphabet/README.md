<p>Given the Welsh Alphabet, which is slightly different than the English one, design a function that sorts a list of words by that alphabet:</p>
<p>"a b c ch d dd e f ff g ng h i j l ll m n o p ph r rh s t th u w y"</p>
<p>Note: "double" letters supersede single letters so "ng" would be considered in its current order and not as an "n g".</p>
