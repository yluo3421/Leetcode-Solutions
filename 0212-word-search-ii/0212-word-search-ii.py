        The overall workflow of the algorithm is intuitive, which consists of a loop over each cell in the board and a recursive function call starting from the cell. Here is the skeleton of the algorithm.

We build a Trie out of the words in the dictionary, which would be used for the matching process later.

Starting from each cell, we start the backtracking exploration (i.e. backtracking(cell)), if there exists any word in the dictionary that starts with the letter in the cell.

During the recursive function call backtracking(cell), we explore the neighbor cells (i.e. neighborCell) around the current cell for the next recursive call backtracking(neighborCell). At each call, we check if the sequence of letters that we traverse so far matches any word in the dictionary, with the help of the Trie data structure that we built at the beginning.
